# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Implementation

## Overview

The project aims to design and implement a MLP from scratch. The MLP model can be used for both classification and regression problems. The architecture is customizable, allowing the user to define the topology, activation function, and learning rate for the model.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the functioning of a neural network and how different configurations can affect its performance.

## Features

- Implements a multi-layer perceptron with customizable topology, activation functions, and loss functions.
- Supports different activation functions: Sigmoid, ReLU, and Linear.
- Supports different loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss.
- Provides a backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network.
